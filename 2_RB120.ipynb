    "### Handling exceptions \n",
    "An exception is simply an exceptional state in your code. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is Ruby’s way of letting you know that your code is behaving unexpectedly. If an exception is raised and your code does not handle the exception, your program will crash and Ruby will provide a message telling you what type of error was encountered.\n",
    "- Most often, the errors you want to handle are descendents of the StandardError.\n",
    "- Why not just handle all exceptions? Doing so can be very dangerous. Some exceptions are more serious than others; there are some errors that we should allow to crash our program. \n",
    "- Using a begin/rescue block to handle errors can keep your program from crashing if the exception you have specified is raised\n",
    "\n",
    "```ruby \n",
    "begin\n",
    "  # put code at risk of failing here\n",
    "rescue TypeError\n",
    "  # take action\n",
    "rescue ArgumentError\n",
    "  # take a different action\n",
    "rescue ZeroDivisionError, TypeError\n",
    "  # take action \n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Remember not to tell Ruby to rescue Exception class exceptions. Doing so will rescue all exceptions down the Exception class hierarchy and is very dangerous, as explained previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exception objects\n",
    "`rescue TypeError => e`\n",
    "- The syntax in the above code rescues any TypeError, and assigns the exception object to `e`.\n",
    "- You can then call `message`, `backtrace` and more on `e`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ruby \n",
    "begin\n",
    "  # code at risk of failing here\n",
    "rescue StandardError => e   # storing the exception object in e\n",
    "  puts e.message            # output error message\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `ensure`\n",
    "- An `ensure` clause in your begin/rescue block after the last rescue clause will always execute, whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "- Example: Whether or not an exception was raised when working with the file, you want to ensure that the file is closed. \n",
    "- The ensure clause serves as a single exit point for the block and allows you to put all of your cleanup code in one place\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `retry`\n",
    "\n",
    "```ruby \n",
    "RETRY_LIMIT = 5\n",

    "  attempts = attempts || 0\n",

    "### Raising exceptions\n",
    "- Ruby gives you the power to manually raise exceptions yourself by calling `Kernel#raise`. \n",
    "- Allows you to choose what type of exception to raise and even set your own error message. \n",
    "- Default error type: RuntimeError\n",
    "- To raise a different error type specify it: `raise TypeError.new(\"Something went wrong!\")`\n",
