    "- LAN (Local Area Network): multiple computers and other devices connected via a network bridging device such as a hub or, more likely, a switch. The computers are all connected to this device via network cables, and this forms the network. The scope of communications is limited to devices that are connected (either wired or wirelessly) to the network switch or hub, which imposes some geographic limitations. That's the 'local' in Local Area Network.\n",
    "- Inter-network Communication: In order to enable communication between networks, we need to add routers into the picture. Routers are network devices that can route network traffic to other networks. Within a Local Area Network, they effectively act as gateways into and out of the network.\n",
    "- Network of networks: We can imagine the internet as a vast number of these networks connected together. In between all of the sub-networks are systems of routers that direct the network traffic."
